- cloth/other object collisions
    - apply inelastic impulse + penalty force?
- friction
- midstep velocity collision handling
    - basically just keep handling the collisions in a loop until there are
    no more collisions detected. If a max iteration number is hit, we can just
    continue until the next time step.
