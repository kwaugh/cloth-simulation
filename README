How to compile and run:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make
bin/cloth

There is no graphical user interface besides a window that appears with the
cloth simulation. Camera controls are implemented (the same camera controls
that were in the graphics menger sponge project). We implemented
everything we described in the milestone 1 project proposal except for the
inclusion of a wind force, namely rendering and internal cloth dynamics. 

We used the dynamics method described in the paper "Large Steps in Cloth
Simulation" by Baraff and Witkin. The forces include gravity, stretching,
shearing, and bending. The time integrator is implicit Euler. We do not have
any damping. The constants we used were from the paper "Implementing Baraff
& Witkin's Cloth Simulation" by David Pritchard with the exception of the
time step.

We plan to move the wind force from milestone 1 to milestone 2. We probably
will not implement tearing in milestone 2 as it seems that cloth collisions are
very involved.

Testing:
We experimented with removing the different forces (Force_Stretch,
Force_Shear, Force_Bending in simulation.cpp) and their
corresponding differentials to make sure the cloth motion appeared
reasonable. We also manually fixed points by not updating their positions
during unbuildConfiguration in cloth.cc. We tried fixing a single corner,
two adjacent corners, two opposite corners, and a single point somewhere in
the middle of the cloth. All these produces visually appealing results.
